#### Creation and iteration
- Given the following dictionary:
```csharp
Dictionary<string, int> transports = new Dictionary<string, int>(){{"bicycle", 2}};
```

- Add some more items to the dictionary.
 - Iterate over the dictionary and write `A ____ has ____ wheels` to the console.
- Each transport should be on a new line.
