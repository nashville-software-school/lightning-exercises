# Lists

#### Creation and iteration
- Given the following list:
```csharp
List<int> numbers = new List<int>(){1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20};
```

- Add more integers to the list
- Iterate over the list and write only odd numbers to the console
- The output should be on the same line.
