>Only assign these after loop-a-looza1

1) Choose a loop method of your choice to get the expected result from this array:
`let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, "5", 6, "7"]`
expected result:
`[3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]`


2)  * Sort the following numbers in descending order
    * Remove any integers greater than 19.
    * Multiply each remaining number by 1.5 and then substract 1.
    * Then output (either in the DOM or the console) the sum of all the resulting numbers.

  ```js
  const integers = [13, 25, 6, 3, 11, 2, 18, 7, 21, 1, 29, 20, 12, 8]
  ```
