* Clone the Grunt-Browserify-Boilerplate
  * Remember to `npm install`, then run `npm start`
* In `main.js` import the domComponent package
  * `import DOMComponent from "nss-domcomponent"`
* Define 2 subclasses of the DOMComponent class
  * an `H1` class
  * a `Div` class

* Make an instance of each subclass
  * Make the `H1` instance first and pass it some content of "I love extending classes"
  * Make the `Div` instance and pass in the `h1` instance as an argument, to add it as a child of the div

* console.log the `div` instance, _or_ append it to the DOM!
