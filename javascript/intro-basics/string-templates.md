## Data types can be combined to output a readable string using template literals

```js
const age = 30
const timeSpan = 25
const futureAge = age + timeSpan
const name = "Biff"
const generationStereotype = "millenial"
const dadJoke = "milleni-old"
```
Use string template literal syntax to create the following sentence from the variables above:

"Hi. My name is Biff, and I'm 30 years old. They say that makes me a millenial. In 25 years I'll be 55! I guess that means I'll be a milleni-old then. Ha ha!"
