Use your Google fu, or look in the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#), to find a way to output the string "I am a rockstar ninja unicorn JS dev" from this array.

You will need to reverse the order of the strings in the array and then join them together into a single string.

```js
let hyperbole = ["dev", "JS", "unicorn", "ninja", "rockstar", "a", "am", "I"]
```
