## JS can access the elements in the DOM

1. Make a basic `index.html` page with an `h1` tag that says "My Favorite Snack" and an `p` tag that contains the string "Spicy Nacho Cheese Doritos and an icy cold Coca-Cola"

1. Create a `main.js` file and add it to your HTML file with a script tag

1. Create a `styles.css` file and include it in your HTML file with a link tag

1. Add this to `styles.css`

```css
.urgent {
  color: red;
}
```

5. Use JavaScript to:

    1. add a class of `urgent` to `title`

    2. change the text of the `p` tag to your actual favorite snack.
