## JS can access the elements in the DOM

1. In your `index.html` page add an `h1` tag that says "My Favorite Snack" and an `p` tag that contains the string "Spicy Nacho Cheese Doritos and an icy cold Coca-Cola"

1. Add this to `styles.css`

```css
.urgent {
  color: red;
}
```

5. Use JavaScript to:

    1. add a class of `urgent` to `title`

    2. change the text of the `p` tag to your actual favorite snack.
