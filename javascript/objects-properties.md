## An object's properties can be accessed by dot notation or bracket notation

```js
let employee = {
  name: "Jeff Winger",
  age: 37,
  department: "legal",
  hire_date: "09/22/2010"
}
```

1. Using the object above, console log "Our company's lawyer is Jeff Winger" using dot notation to access 'name'

2. Console log "Jeff was hired on 09/22/2010" using bracket notation.

3. Add a new key, `vacation_days`, and its value, `20`, to `employee`. Use either dot or bracket notation. Does it matter which one you use? Try both to find out.

```js
let eom = "employee_of_the_month";
```

4. Use the variable above to add a new property to `employee`. Set its value to `false`. Should you use dot or bracket notation?
