Use dot notation to access the value of the key "meaning_of_life" in this object

```
let hitchhikers_guide = {
    characters: ["Zaphod", "Arthur", "Ford", "Trillian"],
    catchphrase: "Don't Panic",
    random_facts: {
        copies_sold: 14000000,
        formats: ["radio", "TV", "film", "graphic novel"],
        ultimate_answer: {
            meaning_of_life: 42
        }
    }
};
```

Now access it with bracket notation using a variable called "meaning": `let meaning = "meaning_of_life"`
