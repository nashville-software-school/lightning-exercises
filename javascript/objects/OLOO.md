1. Make an object with at least three properties. One property should be a method.

1. Create a new object that links to the first object.

1. Give the new object two properties of its own.

1. In the console, call .hasOwnProperty() on the new object, passing in an inherited property as an argument. Does it return true or false?

1. Do it again, but this time pass in one of the properties you added to the new object. True or false?
