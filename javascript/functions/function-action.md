## Functions can perform actions, even calling other functions

<!-- TODO: Possibly refactor to make less difficult -->

1. Create a function that creates an object with three properties: name, age, profession. Have the function take an array as an argument. In the body of the function, loop over the array to set the values of the object's properties. log the result to the console as a table.

2. Create a second function that takes three arguments: name, age, profession. Have the function place the three arguments into an array and pass that array to the first function by calling it.
