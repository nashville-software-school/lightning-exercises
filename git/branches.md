# Git branching workflow:

  * Take any git-ified project you have worked on so far and make a branch <your initials>-mybranch
  * Make some changes to the project. Move some HTML around, or add a new file, or update your CSS
  * Add and commit
  * push up your new branch to GitHub
  * Make a PR
  * Pretend your code was reviewed and given a thumbs-up
  * Merge it!
  * Delete the branch on GitHub
  * Go back to your terminal and checkout master
  * Pull down master to update your local repo
  * Delete the local version of the branch you created
  * Celebrate your git fu!
